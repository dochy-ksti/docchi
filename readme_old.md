Dochy is like a binary diff format of static JSON, and surrounding file systems and tools.

It's intended to replace ordinary data files, 
especially for game/cloud apps which employs auto-save 
and undoable apps.

Let me introduce the key features of this project.

1. [Efficiency](dochy_manual/src/sample_test/sample_code/efficiency.md)
2. [Version Awareness](dochy_manual/src/sample_test/sample_code/version_awareness.md)
3. [Reference and Enum](dochy_manual/src/sample_test/sample_code/ref_and_enum.md)

These three documents(and [this](dochy_manual/src/sample_test/sample_code/history.md))
should work as a walkthrough of Dochy's concepts. 

[Hello World](dochy_manual/src/a1_hello_world/hello_world.md) 
explains the basics.
