### 6. Docchi File

Let's save data in Docchi.

There's two types of save files in Docchi, 
"Docchi File" and "Docchi History".

Docchi File saves the difference from "Docchi Src".

Simply put, Docchi History saves the difference from the previous save file.

We'll talk about Docchi History later. Now let's move on.
```root.json5
{
    message : "Hello World"
}
```
This is the Docchi Src for this section.
