Let's save data in Dochy.

There's two types of save files in Dochy, 
"Dochy File" and "Dochy History".

Dochy File saves the difference from "Dochy Src".

Simply put, Dochy History saves the difference from the previous save file.

We'll talk about Dochy History later. Now let's move on.
```root.json5
{
    message : "Hello World"
}
```
This is the Dochy Src for this section.
